#Snaptack (WIP)
A web app that allows users to post photo galleries on top of images (and
eventually maps).

This was originally written as a quick proof-of-concept weekend hack. So the
code coverage is patchy here and there, the UI is slapped together, and
lots of it isn't implemented yet. But it posts photo galleries on top of
images!

Live demo fork lives at [garrettf.com/snaptack](http://garrettf.com/snaptack).

## To do list
* Speed up tests.
* Test JS.
* Establish complete API
* Make tack/photo creation fully async.
* Switch to a full screen photo gallery
* Allow login through Facebook.
* Proper Facebook comments.
* Clean up UI and make it less bootstrappy
* Integrate Google Maps
